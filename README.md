5 words using 25 unique letters:

current tricks:
-removing anagrams
-indexing words as bitwise charsets with rarest letters most significant digits
-words& partial solutions sorted by bitwise charset
-in general for any partial solution we must either add a word with the rarest unused letter or solemnly swear that said letter is the one remaining. the taboo flag words[:,1] keeps track of whether we still have the option to declare what the remaining letter is.
-using numpy as much as possible.

probably if i want to do this faster i should pick up another programming language
